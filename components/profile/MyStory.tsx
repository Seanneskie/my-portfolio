        led me to code my first simple website in high school and I have been hooked ever since.

      <p className="text-black dark:text-white">
        During college, I discovered how software could solve real problemsâ€”from
        small scripts that saved my classmates hours of work to full-stack
        applications that streamlined campus processes. Each project taught me the
        power of clean design and thoughtful engineering.

        Today I focus on building experiences that feel effortless. Whether it&amp;apos;s a data pipeline or a polished interface, I love turning ideas into
        tools that people actually enjoy using.
